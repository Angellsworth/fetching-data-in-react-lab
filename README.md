# 🌌 Starship Spotter  
_“A long time ago, in a repo far, far away…”_

This React app boldly goes where no frontend has gone before—well, except maybe a few. Welcome to **Starship Spotter**, your intergalactic hub for all things SWAPI. Here, we flex our fetching muscles, build an interface with reusable components, and learn to navigate the React galaxy with `useEffect`, `useState`, and a healthy dose of metadata.

---

## 🚀 What This Does

- Fetches data from the **Star Wars API** (SWAPI) and lists famous (and not-so-famous) starships.
- Lets you search by name or partial match—because who really remembers how to spell _Tantive IV_?
- Displays key details like:
  - `name`
  - `starship_class`
  - `manufacturer`
  - `model`
- Tracks your search like a loyal protocol droid—always ready to reset and return to the full fleet.

## 🛠 Components In Play

- **App**: The mission control of the entire application.
- **StarshipSearch**: Your galactic search console.
- **StarshipList**: The spaceport showing your current hangar of ships.
- **StarshipCard**: One ship. All the facts. Just how the Empire likes it.

## 🧠 Lessons From The Outer Rim

- How to fetch from an API and survive.
- Handling async data with `useEffect`.
- Lifting state and passing props without turning to the Dark Side.
- Displaying dynamic UI that updates in real-time as you search and explore.

---

## ✨ Bonus Features

- Clean UI with metadata tracking.
- Reset button to bring back the full squadron.
- Easily extensible for future missions (Characters, Planets, Wookiee sightings, etc).
